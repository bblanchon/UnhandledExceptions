# Catching unhandled exceptions in Release configuration

Here are example projects showing how to properly catch unhandled exception in:

1. A Console application
2. A WinForm application
3. A WPF application

Exceptions are caught in Release configuration only, so that they are still caught by Visual Studio when you compile in Debug configuration.
